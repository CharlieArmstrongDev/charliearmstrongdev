# Architecture of the CharlieArmstrongDev Project

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture of the charliearmstrongdev project, which is built using Next.js, TypeScript, and React. The project aims to showcase advanced web development techniques and best practices, providing a solid foundation for future enhancements and micro-frontend integrations.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into a monorepo structure using Turborepo, which allows for efficient management of multiple packages and applications. The main components of the project are as follows:

- **Apps**: Contains the main web application.
  - **Web**: The primary application built with Next.js.
    - **App**: Contains the application routes and pages.
    - **Components**: Reusable UI components organized by domain and UI elements.
    - **Lib**: Contains utility functions, API configurations, and database connections.
    - **Public**: Static assets such as images and manifest files.
    - **Styles**: Global styles and Tailwind CSS configurations.
    - **Tests**: Unit and end-to-end tests for the application.

- **Packages**: Contains shared configurations and components.
  - **ESLint Config**: Shared ESLint rules for consistent code quality.
  - **TypeScript Config**: Shared TypeScript settings for type safety.
  - **UI**: A library of reusable UI components.

- **Docs**: Documentation for various aspects of the project, including architecture, CI/CD, performance, and more.

## Key Architectural Concepts

### Domain Driven Design (DDD)
The project follows Domain Driven Design principles, organizing components and features around the core domains of the application (e.g., blog, projects). This approach enhances maintainability and scalability.

### Server Components and Client Components
The application leverages Next.js server components to fetch data directly from the server, improving performance and reducing client-side load. Client components are used for interactive elements that require state management.

### API Layer with tRPC
The project utilizes tRPC for the API layer, implementing a backend-for-frontend pattern. This allows for type-safe API calls and improved performance by reducing the amount of data sent over the network.

### State Management
React Query is used for state management in scenarios where server components cannot be utilized. A caching strategy is implemented to optimize data fetching and minimize unnecessary API calls.

### Authentication
Clerk is integrated for user authentication, providing a seamless sign-in and sign-up experience. Next.js middleware is used to manage authentication checks and redirects.

### Performance Optimization
The project employs various performance optimization techniques, including:
- Dynamic imports for heavy components.
- Optimized loading states and suspense boundaries.
- Image optimization using Next.js's built-in image component.

### Edge Functions
Next.js edge functions are utilized for geolocation-based functionality and authentication checks, enhancing the responsiveness of the application.

### CI/CD Pipeline
The project includes a CI/CD pipeline configured with GitHub Actions for linting, type checking, running tests, and deploying to Vercel. This ensures code quality and streamlined deployment processes.

## Conclusion
This architecture document serves as a guide for understanding the structure and design principles of the charliearmstrongdev project. It highlights the use of modern technologies and best practices to create a robust and scalable web application. Future enhancements, including micro-frontend integrations, will build upon this foundation.
