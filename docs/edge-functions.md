# Edge Functions in the CharlieArmstrongDev Project

## Overview
Edge functions are serverless functions that run at the edge of the network, closer to the user. This allows for faster response times and reduced latency, as the functions can be executed in locations geographically closer to the user. In this project, we leverage edge functions to enhance performance and provide dynamic capabilities.

## Use Cases
1. **Authentication Checks**: Edge functions can be used to verify user authentication status before allowing access to certain routes. This ensures that only authorized users can access protected resources.
   
2. **Geolocation-Based Functionality**: By utilizing edge functions, we can implement features that depend on the user's location, such as displaying localized content or services.

3. **A/B Testing**: Edge functions can facilitate A/B testing by routing users to different versions of a page based on predefined criteria, allowing for real-time experimentation.

4. **Internationalization (i18n)**: Edge functions can help serve content in different languages based on the user's location or preferences, enhancing the user experience for a global audience.

## Implementation
### Setting Up Edge Functions
To implement edge functions in our Next.js application, we can create API routes that are deployed as edge functions. This is done by specifying the `runtime` option in the API route file.

Example:
```typescript
// apps/web/app/api/geo/route.ts
export const config = {
  runtime: 'edge',
};

export default async function handler(req: Request) {
  const { geo } = req;
  return new Response(JSON.stringify({ location: geo }), {
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  });
}
```

### Middleware for Authentication
We can use Next.js middleware to handle authentication checks at the edge. This middleware can redirect users based on their authentication status.

Example:
```typescript
// apps/web/middleware.ts
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export function middleware(req) {
  const isAuthenticated = checkUserAuthentication(req); // Implement this function
  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    return NextResponse.redirect('/sign-in');
  }
  return NextResponse.next();
}
```

### Deploying Edge Functions
When deploying the application to Vercel, the edge functions will automatically be deployed as part of the serverless infrastructure. Ensure that the routes are correctly configured in the `next.config.js` file.

## Benefits of Using Edge Functions
- **Reduced Latency**: By executing functions closer to the user, we minimize the time it takes to process requests.
- **Scalability**: Edge functions can scale automatically based on demand, handling spikes in traffic without manual intervention.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Only pay for the compute time used by the functions, which can lead to cost savings compared to traditional server setups.

## Conclusion
Edge functions are a powerful feature that can significantly enhance the performance and capabilities of charliearmstrongdev. By implementing authentication checks, geolocation features, A/B testing, and internationalization, we can create a more dynamic and responsive user experience.
