# Advanced TypeScript Usage in the Project

This document outlines the advanced TypeScript concepts and patterns utilized in the charliearmstrongdev project. The goal is to leverage TypeScript's features to enhance code quality, maintainability, and developer experience.

## 1. Generic Components

Generic components allow for the creation of reusable components that can work with a variety of data types. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the component's behavior needs to adapt based on the type of data it receives.

### Example

```tsx
// A generic Button component
import React from "react";

type ButtonProps<T> = {
  onClick: (value: T) => void;
  label: string;
  value: T;
};

const Button = <T,>({ onClick, label, value }: ButtonProps<T>) => {
  return <button onClick={() => onClick(value)}>{label}</button>;
};

export default Button;
```

## 2. Utility Types

TypeScript provides several utility types that can be used to create new types based on existing ones. These are particularly useful for defining props and state in a concise manner.

### Example

```ts
type User = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
};

type UserPreview = Pick<User, "id" | "name">; // Only includes id and name
```

## 3. Discriminated Unions

Discriminated unions allow for the creation of types that can represent multiple shapes of data. This is useful for state management where the state can have different forms.

### Example

```ts
type LoadingState = { status: "loading" };
type SuccessState = { status: "success"; data: string };
type ErrorState = { status: "error"; error: string };

type State = LoadingState | SuccessState | ErrorState;

const handleState = (state: State) => {
  switch (state.status) {
    case "loading":
      return "Loading...";
    case "success":
      return `Data: ${state.data}`;
    case "error":
      return `Error: ${state.error}`;
  }
};
```

## 4. Advanced Type Inference

TypeScript's type inference can be leveraged to create more flexible and type-safe APIs. This can be particularly useful in libraries and components that need to adapt to various use cases.

### Example

```ts
function createApi<T>(endpoint: string): Promise<T> {
  return fetch(endpoint).then((response) => response.json());
}

// Usage
createApi<User>("https://api.example.com/user").then((user) => {
  console.log(user.name);
});
```

## 5. Type Guards

Type guards are functions that allow you to narrow down the type of a variable within a conditional block. This is useful for working with union types.

### Example

```ts
function isError(state: State): state is ErrorState {
  return state.status === "error";
}

const state: State = { status: "error", error: "Not found" };

if (isError(state)) {
  console.error(state.error); // TypeScript knows state is ErrorState here
}
```

## Conclusion

By utilizing these advanced TypeScript features, the project can achieve better type safety, improved code readability, and enhanced maintainability. This document serves as a reference for developers working on the project to understand and implement these concepts effectively.
