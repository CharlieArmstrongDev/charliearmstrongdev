## Dependency Management

This project uses pnpm (v10.11.0) for dependency management in a monorepo structure. Key aspects of dependency management include:

- **Monorepo Structure**: Using workspaces for apps and shared packages
- **Dependency Overrides**: Critical dependencies like esbuild (v0.25.5) and undici (v7.10.0) are overridden at the root level
- **Security Patching**: Automatically applies security patches through overrides
- **Version Control**: Specific versions are pinned for core dependencies to ensure stability

To update dependencies:

```bash
# Check for outdated packages
pnpm outdated

# Update packages safely
pnpm update --interactive
```
